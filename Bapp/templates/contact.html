<h2>Information we collect
First of all, we want you to be assured that we do not read or listen to the content of your messages and/or calls made privately via Save Life Connect and we do not store those messages once they have been delivered to their destination (which by average takes less than one second). If for some reason, the message wasn’t delivered to its destination within up to 2 weeks, it will be deleted from our servers regardless. We collect the minimum information required to achieve the purposes set out in this Policy (see below),and you have the ability to limit such collection, as specified below under 
<br><br>

We may receive certain information about you which is stored on social media sites if users of those sites give us access to their profiles and you are one of their friends or connections, depending upon your settings on those sites.
<br><br>
We will receive other information (e.g. the content you have viewed and interacted with) from your use of our App. When you interact with public accounts on our Service, we may obtain information about those. In addition, we collect information about the accounts you have visited and the content you have viewed in order to improve the relevance of our Services.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Additional Information: We may collect additional information if you access our App through a specific device (e.g. your mobile device’s unique identifier; information about your device’s operating system, your browser, browser or operating system language; your wireless network, and your mobile carrier). We may also collect your WPS location data – you can choose whether to allow this by changing your geolocation tracking settings.

We want you to know that we do not sell your personal information. We only share your personal information with third-parties outside of Save Life Connect, for the purposes listed above, in the following circumstances:

(a) The Save Life Foundation, Inc Family: We may share the information we collect about you with the Save Life Connect foundation family and its affiliates and subsidiaries. The information may be disclosed to: (i) provide joint content and our services (e.g., registration, coordination of membership accounts between the Save Life Connect corporate family, transactions, analytics and customer support); (ii) help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts, violations of our policies, fraud and/or data security breaches.

(b) App Providers and Other Third-Parties: We may disclose your information to service providers and other third-parties under contract who help with providing you our Services or other services provided by third-parties via our Services (such as, but not limited to, fraud and spam investigations, payment processing, site analytics and operations, providing special partnership features in our service, advertising – either on an aggregate non identifiable basis, or using unique identifier which can't trace back to you). They are required to secure the data they receive, so that your personal information is guarded.

(c) Other Entities with Your Consent: We may disclose your information to other third- parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information within the use of integrated services (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service). On the Service, you may have opportunities to express interest in or register for other services. If you do, we will provide information about you to those third-parties, or parties working on their behalf, to implement your request. The transferred data will be governed by third party’s privacy policy.

(e) Change of Control – New Owners: We may share your information with another business entity, if we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business, or are involved in a transaction with similar financial effect. In such a situation we would make reasonable efforts to request that the new combined entity or other structure follow this Policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information was intended to be used differently, we would ask the new entity to provide you with prior notice.
<br><br>
Information You Share Publicly
Some of our Services allow you to share information with others on a public basis. If you post information on a public feature of our Services or through social media sites, plug-ins or other applications, don’t forget this information is public on our Services and, depending upon your privacy settings, may also become public on the Internet. We can’t prevent or control further use of this information so please make sure you only post information that you’re happy to be seen publicly. We may also further use such public information you share, for various reasons, such as improving our service and providing you with relevant content, and analyzing trends.

You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social media sites. Please refer to those third-party sites’ privacy policies and terms of use to learn more about their privacy practices, as we don’t control these.

At this stage, whatever you share publicly is available to the entire Save Life Connect community. If you wish to remove a certain piece of content you have shared in the past, you can do that by deleting that content. It will be removed from our services but may remain on local devices of some users (assuming they have chosen to save it).
<br><br>
Your Choices
We want you to have control over how you communicate. That’s why, for example, you can choose not to share your photo, opt not to receive location-based messages along with many other additional options, which are available within the app.

Every now and then, Save Life Connect may send you notifications about administration and operation of the Service (for example, about your transactions, policy changes, technical issues, etc.). We may also send notifications about offerings by Save Life Connect or third-parties, that we think may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive such notifications, you may adjust your system settings to decline them (if you're using iOS systems) or opt-out at any time from receiving further notifications by not using our service.

Cookies and Tracking Technologies
When you visit the App and/or our Website, we and our business partners may use cookies and other tracking technologies for a variety of purposes. These help to enhance your online experience, for example, by remembering your log-in status and viewing preferences from a previous use of our App when you return later. If you block cookies and tracking technologies you may not be able to access certain portions of our App. You may browse our site without telling us who you are, and we will obtain information about your computer or device (e.g., IP addresses) for the purpose of monitoring and improving our site and Services.

Here are a few additional important things you should know about our use of tracking technologies (e.g., cookies, HTML-5 stored technologies):

We ask for your prior consent to use cookies and tracking technologies policies when you join the App

We offer certain features that are available only through the use of tracking technologies.

We use both session and persistent tracking technologies. Tracking technologies (e.g., cookies) can either be persistent (i.e. they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e. they last only until you close your browser, or until you exit the App). You are always free to decline tracking technologies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of the App and Website. We suggest you refer to the help section of your browser, browser extensions, or installed applications for instructions on blocking, deleting, or disabling tracking technologies such as cookies.

We encode and protect the tracking technologies that Save Life Connect sets so that only we can interpret the information stored in them.

You may come across tracking technologies/cookies from our third-party service providers that we have allowed on our App to assist us with various aspects of our App operations and services, such as Google Analytics.

You also may encounter tracking technologies from third-parties on certain pages of websites that we do not control and have not authorized. (For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page.)

For more information about the use of cookies and similar technology on our App, please take a look at our Cookies and Tracking Technologies Policy.

Accessing, Reviewing, and Changing Your Personal Information
As a registered member, you can review and change personal information at any time by accessing your account on the App. Please be sure to update your personal information promptly if it changes or becomes inaccurate. We may retain some information from closed accounts so that we can comply with law, prevent fraud, assist with investigations, resolve disputes, analyze, or troubleshoot programs, enforce our Terms of Use, or take other actions permitted by law. Likewise, if your account or membership is terminated or suspended, we may maintain some information to prevent you from re-registering.
<br><br>
Security
We know that security is important to our users and we care about the security of your information. We maintain technical, physical, and administrative security measures to protect the security of your personal information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration. Some of the safeguards we use include firewalls, data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers and information access authorization controls. We need your help too: it is your responsibility to make sure that your personal information is accurate and that your password(s) and account registration information are secure and not shared with third-parties.
<br><br>
Children’s Privacy
Our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13. Therefore we do not knowingly collect personal information via our websites, applications, services, or tools from anyone under 13.
<br<br>
International Transfer
We operate internationally and provide our Services to Save Life Connect users worldwide allowing them to communicate with each other across the globe. That means that your personal information may need to be processed in countries where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in your home country. We store and process your personal information on our computers in the United States, Asia, Europe (including Russia) and in other locations and use service providers that may be located in various locations outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). In such cases, we will require the recipient to provide appropriate protection for the personal information disclosed to it in compliance with applicable data protection laws.
<br><br>
Updates to this Policy
From time to time, as our services evolve, we may update this Policy. You agree that we may notify you about material changes in the way we treat personal information by placing a notice on the App. Please check the App frequently for updates.
<br><br>
Contact Us
If you still have questions about our privacy policy, please feel free to send us an email to privacy@save.life.

In the event you read this Privacy Policy in any language other than English, you agree that in the event of any discrepancies, the English version shall prevail.
